          <p> As Team 43, we visited Baku Secondary School No. 212 in Narimanov district on November 7, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. to share our programming skills and knowledge about algorithms with children in our neighborhood school via code.org website. They showed great interest and determination during the event. Team members started the event with a short introduction about ADA University Team members, then gave basic information about how to code and assisted students whenever needed. At the end of the event, students who completed the Classic Maze puzzle were awarded certificates. Students who finished early got their certificates and left the room as they had other classes. They became inspirations for others who hadn’t finished yet and increased their desire to successfully finish the course. Finally, this event showed us that even people who don’t have any understanding and experience of coding can learn it with a little effort and dedication.</p>
